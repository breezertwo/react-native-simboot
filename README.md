## react-native-simboot

Tired from searching for udids for a new simulator? A colleague wants to see the prototype on his own phone just "real quick"?

This script will speed up deploying your ReactNative app to a simulator or a device.
It searches for any available simulator or device, without having to look for UDID or device names by yourself.
The script will also pick up any configured build configurations for your project and let's you choose what you want to build.

### Install

yarn:

```
yarn add -D react-native-simboot
```

npm:

```
npm i -D react-native-simboot
```

### Use

Simply run in the root folder of your RN project:

```
npx react-native simboot --ios      # run ios build
npx react-native simboot --android  # run android build (not ready yet)
```

### Additional flags

#### Specify project path

Usually the project files are located in the ios and android folders. If you have a different structure, you can specify the path to the Xcode project and the Gradle project with these flags.

If you have set the locations in `react-native.config.js`, they should be automatically detected.

```
--ios-xcodeproj-path [string]       # specify custom xcode project path
--android-gradle-path [string]      # specify custom build.gradle path (not ready yet)
```

### Prerequisites
